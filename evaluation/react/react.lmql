   "Tho 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\n"

   "Act 4: Search 'eastern sector'\n"
   "Obs 4: The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\n"
   "Tho 5: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains.  So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\n"
   "Act 6: Search 'High Plains'\n\n"
   "Obs 6: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions."
   "Tho 7: I need to instead search High Plains (United States)."
